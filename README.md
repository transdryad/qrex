QREX
An executable, in a qr code.
to build, run build.sh. nasm, base64, and qrencode are required.
qrex32 is from [here](https://www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/software/tiny/teensy.html).
qrex64 is from [here](https://tuket.github.io/notes/asm/elf64_hello_world/). These two are just the smallest nice ones, (ie they exit with exit code 42, reachable with "./qrex.out ; echo $?".) I added some more. (Interactivity!)
